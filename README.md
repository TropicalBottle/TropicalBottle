# Who I am ?
## Little presentation 👨🏻:
Distinguished greetings!
I am a 20 years old student in LP MDN and in a company as web master.
I have not always been very attracted to programming, loving in my childhood to write stories without ever stopping. 

## Why my love for programming 💻?
### The game who made that happen 🕹️
It's while playing "Life Is Strange" and seeing all the emotions that could be retranscribed by a videogame format that I got interested in programming and that was the beginning of a passion for game development.

### What make me stay ✒️
Being able to create our worlds, play them, and share them with the world gave me a very strong feeling. I was spending my time to link projects and I forced myself to change every week to never get bored. Unfortunately, I lost everything because of a nice usb key inserted in a hacked computer of my high school... But that didn't stop my desire to create!

This passion is unfortunately on pause for the time of my DUT, but I have every day the desire to dive back into it! I hated web programming until I arrived in my DUT, and seeing that it was actually very powerful I plunged into it! 

## Why don't I have projects on my GitHub ? 🔧
### Feeling of having nothing incredible to post 😥
I don't have time to work on big project, or even the capacity to realize that. I often change.. Before having project to post I wait to have much better knowledge and organisation. But I can't wait to participate on open source project !
